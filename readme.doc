This file is part of the TASM to AT&T converter (TA2AS) package!
----------------------------------------------------------------

TA2AS v0.8  (Released 29 January 1996)
======================================

This is the first version of TASM to AT&T converter (TA2AS). Frank van Dijk,
member of SPiRiT!, wrote this utility. It reads in a source file with TASM
syntax and tries(first version remember? :)) to convert it to AT&T syntax.
It hasn't been tested very well. So email all your bugreports to
one of the SPiRiT emailaddresses (see below). Also for wanted features!
But the sourcefile is included so why don't you try first :)

This is one of the utilities we wrote, to make life easier when working
with DJGPP! :)

Other utilities are:
- OBJ to COFF converter (O2C)
- FSDB with screen/graphics save, timer/keyboard interruptsaving and program
  reset!

I had to make this package in a hurry, so errors are likely :(
