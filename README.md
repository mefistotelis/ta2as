# Ta2As, Intel(TAsm) to AT&T(As) converter

# Introduction

This tool converts assembly syntax from TASM (also called Intel syntax, 
or 'destination first' syntax). to GNU As syntax (also called AT&T syntax,
or 'destination last' syntax).

# Building

Windows batch file and Unix BASH scripts are included.
Just run one of these, and it will build the tool.

# What's unmodified copy

The tool was released by the SPiRiT group with particular license requirements.
See [license document](LICENSE.md) for details. The license requirements are the
only reason and purpose of the `unmodified_copy` folder, otherwise it is unused.
