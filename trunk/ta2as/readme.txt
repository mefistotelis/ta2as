This file is part of the TASM to AT&T converter (TA2AS) package!
----------------------------------------------------------------

TA2AS v0.8.2  (Released 09 November 2010)
======================================

Many improvements were made, mostly for compatibility with the code
generated in "IDA Pro, the interactive disassembler".

I've decided to make these modifications because I needed to compile
the assembly generated by IDA Pro inside GCC. I know recent versions of
GCC can use Intel syntax too, but I'm just more familiar with AT&T one.

There are still some things to do:
- An array with all labels from the input file would be required
  to properly size memory locations which use labels.
- Better command line options analysis is needed, to support GNU style,
  ie: ta2as <input> -o <output> --ccembeded
  The option "ccembeded" would allow to generate code prepared for
  pasting into .c/.cpp files.
- Not all Intel specific directives are understood and replaced

TA2AS v0.8  (Released 29 January 1996)
======================================

This is the first version of TASM to AT&T converter (TA2AS). Frank van Dijk,
member of SPiRiT!, wrote this utility. It reads in a source file with TASM
syntax and tries(first version remember? :)) to convert it to AT&T syntax.
It hasn't been tested very well. So email all your bug reports to
one of the SPiRiT email addresses (see below). Also for wanted features!
But the source file is included so why don't you try first :)

This is one of the utilities we wrote, to make life easier when working
with DJGPP! :)

Other utilities are:
- OBJ to COFF converter (O2C)
- FSDB with screen/graphics save, timer/keyboard interrupt saving and program
  reset!

Contact information
===================

Here are several email addresses you can send email too in case of bug-reports,
wanted features or just for a good talk:

jan@stack.urc.tue.nl        Trax (also for a good talk about 3D and stuff)
george@charm.il.ft.hse.nl   El Greco
mb002@il.ft.hse.nl          Rico

Most of the SPiRiT! members are studying Computer Science at the
'Hogere School' in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.
